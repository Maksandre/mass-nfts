# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk you through setting up your development environment. We'll cover the installation of git, node.js, and ensuring that everything is properly configured.

> ðŸ’¡ If you have prior knowledge of Node.js, npm, and Git, feel free to skip this guide and proceed directly to the [main section](./README.md).

### 1. Install Node.js

There are various methods to install Node on your machine. One option is via package manager [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) or by downloading the [installer directly](https://nodejs.org/en).

> ðŸ’¡ We recommend using the node 16x version because compatibility with it is well tested. However, it is likely that higher versions will also work well.
> 
Once youâ€™re done, run `node --version` on a terminal to check your installation:

```sh
node --version
```

### 2. Install Git

Check your version running following command in your terminal:

```sh
git -v
```

If you see your version, e.g. `git version 2.40.1` you already have git installed. If you don't see a version number, please follow the instructions provided on the [official website](https://git-scm.com/)

After installation, check your version again.

### 3. Optional: Install IDE

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).


ðŸŽ‰ Great! You're all set now. Feel free to proceed to the [main section](./README.md).
